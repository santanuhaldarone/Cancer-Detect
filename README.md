# 🧬 Cancer-Detect - SVM-Based Breast Cancer Classifier

Welcome to **Cancer-Detect** — a simple yet powerful machine learning project that uses an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model to classify whether a tumor is malignant or benign, based on 30 features from the popular Breast Cancer dataset.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔬 Uses **SVM** for high-accuracy classification  
- 📊 Based on **sklearn's breast cancer dataset**  
- 📁 Clean folder structure  
- 💡 Proper separation of logic via `utils.py`  
- 🖥️ Built with **Streamlit** for a lightweight web interface  
- 📦 Packaged with `requirements.txt` for easy setup

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santanuhaldarone/Cancer-Detect.git
cd Cancer-Detect


### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Train the Model (Optional)

If not using the pre-trained model, open `train.ipynb` and run all cells. It will generate:

```
model/svm_model.pkl
model/model_scaler.pkl
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 Dataset Info

This project uses the `load_breast_cancer()` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`, which includes:

- 30 numerical features per tumor  
- 569 samples  
- Binary classification:  
  - `0` = malignant (cancer)  
  - `1` = benign (no cancer)
